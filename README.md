## Installation

Berkshelf is now included as part of the [Chef Workstation](https://downloads.chef.io/tools/workstation). This is fastest, easiest, and the recommended installation method for getting up and running with Berkshelf.

> note: You may need to uninstall the Berkshelf gem especially if you are using a Ruby version manager you may need to uninstall all Berkshelf gems from each Ruby installation.

### From Rubygems

If you are a developer or you prefer to install from Rubygems, we've got you covered.

Add Berkshelf to your repository's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'berkshelf'
```

Or run it as a standalone:

```shell
$ gem install berkshelf
```

## Usage

See [docs.chef.io](https://docs.chef.io/workstation/berkshelf/) for up-to-date usage instructions.

## CLI Usage

Berkshelf is intended to be used as a CLI tool.  It is not intended to be used as a library.  Other ruby code should shell out to the command line tool to use it.

## Supported Platforms

Berkshelf is tested and supported on Ruby 2.4 and later.

## Configuration

Berkshelf will search in specific locations for a configuration file. In order:

    $PWD/.berkshelf/config.json
    ~/.berkshelf/config.json

You are encouraged to keep project-specific configuration in the `$PWD/.berkshelf` directory. A default configuration file is generated for you, but you can update the values to suit your needs.
